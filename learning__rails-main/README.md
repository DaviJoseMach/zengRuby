# LearningRails

This repository is dedicated to learning Ruby on Rails, a Ruby web development framework.

## What is Ruby on Rails?

[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) (also known as Rails) is an open source web development framework written in Ruby. It is designed to make web development faster and easier by following the principle of convention over configuration (CoC) and the Ruby programming language.

## Main Rails Concepts

Here are some key Ruby on Rails concepts:

| Concept | Description |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| MVC (Model-View-Controller) | Architectural pattern for web development. |
| Active Record | Rails database abstraction layer. |
| RESTful Routing | Standard for mapping URLs to controller actions. |
| Gems | Reusable Ruby libraries and extensions. |

## Installing Ruby on Rails

If you don't already have Ruby on Rails installed on your machine, follow these steps:

```bash
# Install Ruby (if not already installed)
$ sudo apt-get install ruby-full

# Install Rails
$ gem install rails
```

## Running the Rails Server

After installing Rails, you can start a Rails server with the following command:

```bash
$ rails s
```

This will start the development server on the default port 3000. You can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
